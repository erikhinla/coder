[Coder](https://coder.com) is a powerful platform that enables organizations to provision secure, consistent development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure.

With Coder, development environments are:
- Defined as code using Terraform
- Connected through a secure high-speed WireguardÂ® tunnel
- Automatically shut down when not in use to optimize costs
- Accessible from anywhere with an internet connection

Coder empowers engineering teams with the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads that best suit their needs, while maintaining security and consistency across the organization.

- Define cloud development environments in Terraform
  - EC2 VMs, Kubernetes Pods, Docker Containers, etc.
- Automatically shutdown idle resources to save on costs
- Onboard developers in seconds instead of days

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started with Coder is to install it on your local machine and provision development environments using Docker. This method works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Step 1: Install Coder

```shell
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Step 2: Start the Coder server

```shell
# Data is cached in ~/.cache/coder
coder server
```

### Step 3: Set up your first workspace

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Create your initial admin user
3. Add a Docker template
4. Provision your first workspace

For more detailed instructions, visit our [Getting Started guide](https://coder.com/docs/getting-started).

## Install

The easiest way to install Coder is to use our
[install script](https://github.com/coder/coder/blob/main/install.sh) for Linux
and macOS. For Windows, use the latest `..._installer.exe` file from GitHub
Releases.

```shell
curl -L https://coder.com/install.sh | sh
```

You can run the install script with `--dry-run` to see the commands that will be used to install without executing them. Run the install script with `--help` for additional flags.

> See [install](https://coder.com/docs/install) for additional methods.

Once installed, you can start a production deployment with a single command:

```shell
# Automatically sets up an external access URL on *.try.coder.app
coder server

# Requires a PostgreSQL instance (version 13 or higher) and external access URL
coder server --postgres-url <url> --access-url <url>
```

Use `coder --help` to get a list of flags and environment variables. Use our [install guides](https://coder.com/docs/install) for a complete walkthrough.
